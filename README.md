Datapack + Resource Pack that adds tool trims (uses the same templates & resources as armour trims)

Crafting is also the same as armour trims.

Currently:
* Pickaxe
* Axe
* Shovel
* Hoe
* Sword

Planned (Whenever I get a around to making texture for them):
* Bow
* Crossbow
* Fishing Rod (potentially Carrot/Warped fungus on a stick for consistency)
* Trident
* Mace
